## Welcome to the project website of I4S

This is just one component of the I4S family. To explore all components, browse through the repositories starting with 'I4S_' [here](https://github.com/flhofer/).
The website is under construction and will be updated in the following weeks.

### Contents of the main repository

The main repository contains scripts and Python code for the automated execution of the tests according to pre-established parameters. The code will be responsible for device management, communication and parameter download to the connected micro-controllers.  
Please see the project documentation for further detail.

### I4S_LoRaWanNode

[Link](https://github.com/flhofer/I4S_LoRaWanNode)

The I4S* project investigates behavioral models of large scale LoRaWan networks used in smart contexts. This repository contains the micro-controller code for a _Harward architecture_ micro-controller for end-node testing. The AVR micro-controller performs regular transmissions in different configurations to test the performance of the network and the communication reliability. Transmission time samples will describe the behavior of the system and allow the creation of a model.

### I4S_LoRaWanTest

Similarly to the previous, this repository contains the micro-controller code for a _VN architecture_ micro-controller for end-node interference testing. The SamD micro-controller performs different kinds of transmissions to test the resilience of the network. They embed thus an accessory role
