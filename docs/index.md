## Welcome to the project website of I4S

This is just one component of the I4S family. To explore all components, browse through the repositories starting with 'I4S_' [here](https://github.com/flhofer/).
The website is under construction and will be updated in the following weeks.

### I4S_LoRaWanNode

[Link](https://github.com/flhofer/I4S_LoRaWanNode)

The I4S* project investigates behavioral models of large scale LoRaWan networks used in smart contexts. This repository contains the micro-controller code for a _Harward architecture_ micro-controller for end-node testing. The AVR micro-controller performs regular transmissions in different configurations to test the performance of the network and the communication reliability. Transmission time samples will describe tbe behavior of the system and allow the creation of a model.
